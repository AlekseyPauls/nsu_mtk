# This is an example of FCM description file
# Lines started with '#' are comments. You can`t write comment in one line with final states or transition rules,
# write comments before commenting line
# First not commented line is final states list. Final states must be a number bigger than 0.
# There is must to be at least one final state
1
# All other lines are transition rules in format "start_state(number > 0) symbol(latin character) end_state(number > 0)"
# Character case matters. Transition rules can`t be duplicated.
